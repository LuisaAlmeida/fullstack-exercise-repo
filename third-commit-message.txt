Third commit. 
This commit was all about css implementations so that the website visual style is closer to the image example on the instructions pdf file


1.ReviewItem.css
I did not created any new css selectors, but added & changed properties.
 On the .review-item I added {
 	padding: 20px;
	border-style: solid;
	border-color: #80808029;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center; }

 On the .features I added {
 	width: 350px;
 	justify-content: center;  }
 
 On the .play-now-terms-container {
	align-items: center;
 }
 
 On the .play-now-terms-container {
	align-items: center;
 }
 
 On the .play-now I changed the { 
 	padding: 20px 20px; TO padding: 20px 40px;}
 	& added  {width: fit-content;}
 
 
2. ReviewList.css
On this css file I created the .review-items class
I added the .review-list to style the className="review-list" with "width: fit-content;" so that the display looks more organized
I added the .table-items to style the <div class="table-items"> with "display: flex;" &
	"justify-content: center;" so that all the reviews display are all centered on the webpage
The Line css was implemented so that the visual of the <div className="line"></div>is more simillar to
	the one of the PDF intructions image. The box shadow property was my way to create a subtle shadow effect around the line


3. LoadMoreButton.css
These implementations aimed to center the button correctly & adding additional color, font-weight and width
On the .load-more-container I added "justify-content: center;"
On the .load-more-button I updated the "padding from 20px 20px" to "15px 20px", updated the "width from 300px" to "fit-content"	
	&& added font-size: 18px; color: white; font-weight: bold; border: none;
